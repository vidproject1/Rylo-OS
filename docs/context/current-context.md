# Current Context Snapshot

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-06 18:47 UTC  
**AI Model**: Claude (Anthropic)  
**Session**: Initial project setup

## Project Status
- **Phase**: 0 - Foundation & Documentation
- **Progress**: 60% complete
- **Timeline**: On track for Phase 0 completion this week
- **Next Milestone**: Complete tooling setup and begin Phase 1

## Current Objectives
1. **In Progress**: Documentation framework setup ✓
2. **Pending**: Automated documentation tools
3. **Pending**: Git repository initialization
4. **Pending**: Context handoff protocols
5. **Pending**: Development environment setup

## Recent Accomplishments (Today)
- Complete documentation structure created
- Project README and navigation established
- Architecture overview and roadmap documented
- ADR system implemented with template and first decision
- Daily journal system established

## Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Target**: x86-64 educational operating system
2. **Languages**: C (primary), Assembly (low-level)
3. **Boot**: UEFI/BIOS compatible bootloader
4. **Development**: 7-phase approach over ~60 weeks
5. **Testing**: QEMU emulation environment

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create documentation automation tools
2. Initialize Git repository with proper structure
3. Set up cross-compilation toolchain
4. Install and configure QEMU
5. Create context handoff protocol template

## Technical Environment
- **OS**: Windows
- **Shell**: PowerShell 5.1
- **Directory**: `C:\Users\charles\Documents\tests\Rylo OS`
- **User**: charles

## Critical Context for AI Transitions
- User is committed to multi-year development timeline
- Documentation quality is absolutely critical
- Project must remain coherent across context windows
- Phase-based approach with strict completion criteria
- Educational focus - code should teach OS concepts

## Known Constraints
- Context window limitations in long conversations
- Potential for AI model transitions during development
- Windows development environment (cross-compilation needed)
- Solo developer project (user + AI assistance)

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- [ ] All documentation tools functional
- [ ] Git repository initialized and structured
- [ ] Development environment verified
- [ ] Phase 1 planning complete
- [ ] Context handoff protocols established

## Warnings & Important Notes
- Never proceed to Phase 1 until Phase 0 completion criteria met
- Maintain strict documentation discipline from day one
- All architectural decisions must be recorded as ADRs
- Regular checkpoint creation essential for project continuity

**AI Handoff Instructions**  
When transitioning to a new AI model or session:
1. Read this context file first
2. Review today's journal entry: `docs/journal/2025-08-06.md`
3. Check roadmap status: `docs/architecture/roadmap.md`
4. Review recent ADRs in `docs/decisions/`
5. Update this file with any new context before ending session
