# Development Journal - 2025-08-06

## Session Summary
**Start Time**: 18:41 UTC  
**Duration**: In Progress  
**Phase**: Phase 0 - Foundation & Documentation  
**AI Model**: Claude (Anthropic)

## Today's Objectives
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation system
- [x] Establish project structure
- [x] Create initial ADRs and templates
- [ ] Set up automated documentation tools
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create context handoff protocols

## Accomplishments

### Documentation Framework
- Created complete documentation hierarchy (`/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/decisions/`, etc.)
- Established main project README with navigation
- Wrote comprehensive architecture overview
- Created detailed development roadmap with 7 phases
- Set up ADR system with template and first decision record

### Project Structure
- Organized directories for tools, checkpoints, and documentation
- Created modular structure for long-term maintainability
- Established clear separation between architecture, implementation, and meta-documentation

### Architecture Planning
- Defined target as x86-64 educational OS
- Outlined 7 development phases from bootloader to user space
- Established design principles emphasizing simplicity and documentation
- Created 60-week development timeline

## Key Decisions Made
1. **ADR-001**: Comprehensive documentation system approved
2. Target architecture: x86-64 with UEFI/BIOS compatibility
3. Primary language: C with Assembly for low-level operations
4. Development approach: Phase-based with strict completion criteria

## Challenges Encountered
- None significant - initial setup phase proceeding smoothly
- User expressed concern about context management over long project duration
- Potential complexity of maintaining documentation quality over time

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Complete documentation tooling setup
2. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
3. Set up development environment (compiler toolchain, QEMU)
4. Create context handoff protocols
5. Begin Phase 1: Bootloader research and planning

## Context for Future Sessions
- Project is in very early stage (Phase 0)
- Focus on establishing solid foundation before any coding
- User is committed to multi-year timeline
- Documentation quality is critical for project success
- Need to prepare for potential AI model transitions

## Technical Notes
- Using PowerShell on Windows
- Current directory: `C:\Users\charles\Documents\tests\Rylo OS`
- Documentation using Markdown for human readability
- Planning JSON/YAML integration for machine parsing

## Code/Files Modified Today
- `README.md` - Main project overview
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` - System architecture
- `docs/architecture/roadmap.md` - Development roadmap
- `docs/decisions/000-adr-template.md` - ADR template
- `docs/decisions/001-documentation-system.md` - Documentation ADR
- `docs/journal/2025-08-06.md` - This journal entry

**End of Session Notes**  
Documentation framework successfully established. Ready to proceed with tooling and Git initialization.  
**Status**: Phase 0 in progress, on track for completion this week.

## Session Addendum: Phase II Completion (22:45 UTC)

**Focus**: Bootloader Development and 64-bit Transition
**Status**: Phase II Complete

### Summary of Accomplishments

In a highly productive session, we successfully completed the entire boot chain for Rylo OS. We now have a stable, 64-bit operating system that boots from a custom MBR, transitions through protected mode into long mode, and executes a 64-bit kernel. This establishes the fundamental architecture for all future work.

### Final Architecture Details

- **Stage 1 Bootloader (`stage1-lba.asm`)**: A robust 512-byte MBR that uses modern LBA reads to load Stage 2.
- **Stage 2 Bootloader (`stage2-64bit-lba.asm`)**: A comprehensive loader that performs the full CPU mode transition to 64-bit long mode, using LBA to load the kernel and setting up a 4-level paging system.
- **64-bit Kernel (`test_kernel_64.asm`)**: A proof-of-concept assembly kernel that confirms successful entry into 64-bit mode.

### Key Bugs Resolved

- **Disk Reads**: Replaced all unreliable CHS disk reads with modern LBA reads.
- **Memory Layout**: Corrected the build script to prevent the kernel from overwriting Stage 2.
- **Triple Fault**: Fixed a corrupt GDT definition that was causing a system-wide crash.
- **Kernel Jump**: Corrected the final jump to the kernel to use an absolute address, fixing a hang.

This completes the work for Phase II. The system is now ready for Phase III: C Kernel Development and Memory Management.
