- [ ] System documentation

## Success Criteria
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:
1. All objectives completed
2. All deliverables documented
3. Code compiles and runs in QEMU
4. Comprehensive testing completed
5. Architecture decisions recorded
6. Context fully documented for AI handoff

## Risk Mitigation
- **Context Loss**: Regular checkpoints and comprehensive documentation
- **Complexity Creep**: Strict phase boundaries and simple implementations
- **Technical Blocks**: Multiple approaches documented for each challenge
- **Motivation**: Regular demos and visible progress milestones
