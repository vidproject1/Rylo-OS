# Development Journal - 2025-08-06

## Session Summary
**Start Time**: 18:41 UTC  
**Duration**: In Progress  
**Phase**: Phase 0 - Foundation & Documentation  
**AI Model**: Claude (Anthropic)

## Today's Objectives
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation system
- [x] Establish project structure
- [x] Create initial ADRs and templates
- [ ] Set up automated documentation tools
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create context handoff protocols

## Accomplishments

### Documentation Framework
- Created complete documentation hierarchy (`/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/decisions/`, etc.)
- Established main project README with navigation
- Wrote comprehensive architecture overview
- Created detailed development roadmap with 7 phases
- Set up ADR system with template and first decision record

### Project Structure
- Organized directories for tools, checkpoints, and documentation
- Created modular structure for long-term maintainability
- Established clear separation between architecture, implementation, and meta-documentation

### Architecture Planning
- Defined target as x86-64 educational OS
- Outlined 7 development phases from bootloader to user space
- Established design principles emphasizing simplicity and documentation
- Created 60-week development timeline

## Key Decisions Made
1. **ADR-001**: Comprehensive documentation system approved
2. Target architecture: x86-64 with UEFI/BIOS compatibility
3. Primary language: C with Assembly for low-level operations
4. Development approach: Phase-based with strict completion criteria

## Challenges Encountered
- None significant - initial setup phase proceeding smoothly
- User expressed concern about context management over long project duration
- Potential complexity of maintaining documentation quality over time

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Complete documentation tooling setup
2. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
3. Set up development environment (compiler toolchain, QEMU)
4. Create context handoff protocols
5. Begin Phase 1: Bootloader research and planning

## Context for Future Sessions
- Project is in very early stage (Phase 0)
- Focus on establishing solid foundation before any coding
- User is committed to multi-year timeline
- Documentation quality is critical for project success
- Need to prepare for potential AI model transitions

## Technical Notes
- Using PowerShell on Windows
- Current directory: `C:\Users\charles\Documents\tests\Rylo OS`
- Documentation using Markdown for human readability
- Planning JSON/YAML integration for machine parsing

## Code/Files Modified Today
- `README.md` - Main project overview
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` - System architecture
- `docs/architecture/roadmap.md` - Development roadmap
- `docs/decisions/000-adr-template.md` - ADR template
- `docs/decisions/001-documentation-system.md` - Documentation ADR
- `docs/journal/2025-08-06.md` - This journal entry
