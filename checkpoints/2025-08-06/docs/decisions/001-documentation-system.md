# ADR-001: Comprehensive Documentation System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Rylo OS is a multi-year operating system development project that will face significant challenges:
- Context window limitations in AI interactions
- Potential model transitions during development
- Complex, interdependent components requiring coherent architecture
- Need for continuity across development sessions
- Risk of losing design decisions and implementation rationale

Traditional documentation approaches are insufficient for maintaining context across such a long-term project with AI assistance.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive, multi-layered documentation system consisting of:

1. **Structured Documentation Hierarchy**
   - `/docs/architecture/` - High-level system design
   - `/docs/decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - `/docs/implementation/` - Module implementation details
   - `/docs/journal/` - Daily development logs
   - `/docs/context/` - AI context snapshots
   - `/docs/diagrams/` - Visual system representations

2. **Living Documentation**
   - Self-updating context snapshots
   - Automated dependency tracking
   - Code-documentation synchronization

3. **Checkpoint System**
   - Regular state dumps of project status
   - Milestone documentation
   - Recoverable project states

4. **Context Handoff Protocol**
   - Standardized AI transition format
   - Current objectives and status
   - Recent changes and next steps

## Consequences

### Positive
- Maintains project coherence across context windows
- Enables seamless AI model transitions
- Provides comprehensive project history
- Reduces risk of architectural inconsistencies
- Creates educational resource documenting OS development process

### Negative
- Significant upfront documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain documentation quality
- Additional complexity in project structure
- Time investment in documentation tools

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Documentation becomes outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Automated validation and update reminders
- **Risk**: Over-documentation slows development
  - **Mitigation**: Templates and automation tools
- **Risk**: Inconsistent documentation quality
  - **Mitigation**: Standard templates and review processes

## Implementation Notes
- Use Markdown for human readability and version control compatibility
- JSON/YAML for machine-parseable metadata
- Git integration for change tracking
- PowerShell scripts for Windows automation
- Regular checkpoint creation (weekly initially)
